# exquery
Visual Seeking Systems Class project

Exquery is a media search engine for students who use the public library. Given an item it will search for similar items. A narrow set of recommendations is preliminarily given to the user after they input a book. If more results are desired keywords from recommendations will be used to expand them. Search engines have several problems: Formulating search queries is hard. It is also challenging to sort through search results. It is important to get the most relevant results first but it is not always clear what “most relevant” means. To solve this, Exquery provides the opportunity not to sort through results finding things that are important to the user, he can save time by filtering for this in the beginning.
